# Intelligent Clinical Interview Analysis, Summarization & Retrieval System
## with Speaker Separation 

An academic information retrieval system that processes clinical interviews through both offline and live ingestion paths, converging into a unified retrieval, ranking, and evaluation pipeline.

---

## 🏗️ Architectural Overview

### Core Principle: Two Ingestion Paths, One Unified Retrieval Core

**Offline Path:**
- Audio file upload → Pyannote diarization → Whisper transcription → Speaker alignment → Unified storage

**Live Path:**
- LiveKit real-time → Speaker-separated streams → Per-speaker Whisper → Unified storage

**Unified Backend:**
- Shared data schemas
- Single indexing logic
- Common retrieval/ranking algorithms
- Unified evaluation pipeline

## 🎯 Folder Responsibilities

### `/n8n`
Orchestration layer. Contains logical workflow descriptions (NOT full JSON exports) showing how components are triggered and connected.

### `/backend`
Core API layer that n8n calls. Exposes endpoints for triggering diarization, transcription, indexing, and retrieval.

### `/diarization`
Offline-only. Runs Pyannote.audio to identify "who spoke when" from audio files.

### `/transcription`
Dual-mode. Batch processing for offline, streaming for live. Both use Whisper.

### `/alignment`
Offline-only. Merges diarization timestamps with transcription text to create speaker-labeled segments.

### `/indexing`
Unified. Receives speaker-labeled segments from BOTH paths and writes to shared index (vector DB + metadata).

### `/retrieval`
Unified. Handles queries, retrieves relevant segments, ranks them, and optionally generates LLM explanations.

### `/evaluation`
Unified. Computes IR metrics and speaker-specific performance on test sets.

### `/frontend`
Optional web UI for demonstrations and manual testing.

### `/docs`
Design documents, setup guides, and architectural decisions.

## 🔄 System Integration Flow

### Offline Ingestion
```
User uploads audio
    ↓
n8n triggers /api/diarization/run
    ↓
Pyannote identifies speaker segments
    ↓
n8n triggers /api/transcription/batch
    ↓
Whisper transcribes entire audio
    ↓
n8n triggers /api/alignment/align
    ↓
Speaker segments + transcript → labeled segments
    ↓
n8n triggers /api/indexing/write
    ↓
Segments stored in unified index
```

### Live Ingestion
```
LiveKit session starts
    ↓
Webhook → n8n triggers /api/transcription/stream
    ↓
Per-speaker audio → Whisper (already separated)
    ↓
Direct speaker-labeled segments
    ↓
n8n triggers /api/indexing/write
    ↓
Segments stored in unified index
```

### Retrieval (Same for Both)
```
User query
    ↓
n8n triggers /api/retrieval/query
    ↓
Retrieve K candidates (speaker-aware filters optional)
    ↓
Rank by relevance
    ↓
LLM generates explanation grounded in segments
    ↓
Return results
```

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Review `/docs/architecture.md` for detailed design
2. Check `/docs/data_schemas.md` for data structures
3. Follow `/docs/setup_guide.md` for environment setup
4. Implement skeletons incrementally per module
5. Run evaluation pipeline on sample data
